# CI/CD Pipeline for MATLAB Algorithm Deployment

# 1. Introduction

* **Purpose:** Briefly state the goals of the CI/CD pipeline, including automated building, testing (if applicable), and deployment of your MATLAB algorithm.
* **Scope:** Mention the project's components involved in the pipeline. (e.g., MATLAB code, Docker images)

# 2. Workflow Overview

* **Trigger:** Explain the event that initiates the pipeline, which in your case, is pushing code to the 'main' branch on GitHub.
* **High-Level Steps:** Provide a simplified list of the main stages executed in the pipeline, such as:
  1. Versioning
  1. Building Docker Images
  1. Tagging and Pushing Images

# 3. Pipeline Breakdown (Detailed)

Provide a detailed explanation of each job and its corresponding steps in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

**Job: push-matlab-algorithm-image**

* **runs-on:** Clarify the execution environment (ubuntu-latest)
* **steps:**
  * **Checkout:** Explain the purpose of checking out the project code.
  * **Semantic Versioning:** Detail the process used for version increment (e.g., major, minor, patch) and how the "anothrNick/github-tag-action" determines and applies new tags.
  * **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) Login:** Describe authentication for pushing images to GHCR.
  * **Build Runtime Base Image:**
    * Outline conditional logic: Build only if the image doesn't exist with the specified tag.
    * Explain the `Dockerfile.deps` purpose (likely installing MATLAB runtime dependencies).
  * **Build Runtime Image:**
    * Similarly, describe the conditional build and the role of `Dockerfile.runtime`.
  * **Build Inventory Image:**
    * Explain how this step bundles the algorithm, potentially using the previously built runtime images.
    * Highlight the tagging strategy: the new semantic version and the 'latest' tag.
  * **Push Inventory Image:** Describe the process of publishing the built and tagged images to GHCR.

# 4. Deployment

* **Strategy:** Explain how the built Docker images are deployed. Do you utilize a separate workflow? Are they deployed manually, or do you use Kubernetes or another orchestration tool?

# 5. Testing (Optional)

* **Unit Tests:** If you have MATLAB unit tests, describe how they are integrated into the pipeline (e.g., in the build stage) and the triggers for test execution.
* **Integration Tests:** If applicable, outline how broader system-level integration tests are incorporated, ensuring the deployed MATLAB algorithm works within the larger application.

# 6. Additional Considerations

* **Security:** Address security measures for GitHub Actions secrets and the GHCR access token.
* **Error Handling:** Outline any error reporting or notification mechanisms integrated into the pipeline.
* **Future Improvements:** Potential areas for pipeline optimization (e.g., caching for Docker builds, parallelizing tests, additional automation steps).
