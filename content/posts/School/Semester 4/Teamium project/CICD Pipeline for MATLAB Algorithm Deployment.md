# CI/CD Pipeline for MATLAB Algorithm Deployment

# 1. Summary

This document outlines the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline implemented for the MATLAB algorithm project. Utilizing GitHub Actions, the pipeline automates the process of building, versioning and deploying Docker images containing the MATLAB algorithm to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). The pipeline is triggered whenever changes are pushed to the 'main' branch, ensuring that the latest version of the algorithm is readily available for deployment, streamlining the development and release process.

# 2. Introduction

**Purpose:** The CI/CD pipeline aims to streamline the development and deployment workflow for the MATLAB algorithm project. Key objectives include:

* **Automation:** Automate the repetitive tasks of building, testing (if applicable), versioning, and publishing Docker images, reducing manual intervention and potential errors.
* **Consistency:** Enforce a consistent pipeline process, ensuring builds and deployments follow predefined steps, promoting reliability.
* **Agility:** Enable frequent updates to the MATLAB algorithm with the confidence that automated processes will build and deploy changes seamlessly.

**Scope:** The pipeline focuses on the following key components:

* **MATLAB Code Repository:** The source code for the MATLAB algorithm, hosted on GitHub.
* **Docker Images:** The containerized format used to package and deploy the MATLAB algorithm.
* **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):** The repository for storing the built Docker images.

# 3. Workflow Overview

**Trigger:**

* The CI/CD pipeline is initiated whenever new code is pushed to the 'main' branch of the GitHub repository.

**High-Level Steps:**

1. **Semantic Versioning:**
   
   * The pipeline determines the appropriate version increment (major, minor, or patch) based on the nature of the committed changes.
   * A new version tag is generated and applied to the Docker image.
1. **Docker Image Build:**
   
   * **Base Image (if needed):** The pipeline checks if a base image with the required MATLAB runtime dependencies exists. If not, a new base image is built.
   * **Runtime Image (if needed):** The pipeline checks if a runtime image exists; if not, it's created. This image potentially layers on top of the base image.
   * **Algorithm Image:** The MATLAB algorithm code is packaged into a Docker image, leveraging the runtime (and potentially the base) image as its foundation. This final artifact is given the new version tag and a "latest" tag.
1. **Image Publishing:**
   
   * The newly built and tagged Docker image containing the MATLAB algorithm is pushed to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

# 4. Pipeline Breakdown (Detailed)

Provide a detailed explanation of each job and its corresponding steps in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

**Job: push-matlab-algorithm-image**

* **runs-on:** Clarify the execution environment (ubuntu-latest)
* **steps:**
  * **Checkout:** Explain the purpose of checking out the project code.
  * **Semantic Versioning:** Detail the process used for version increment (e.g., major, minor, patch) and how the "anothrNick/github-tag-action" determines and applies new tags.
  * **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) Login:** Describe authentication for pushing images to GHCR.
  * **Build Runtime Base Image:**
    * Outline conditional logic: Build only if the image doesn't exist with the specified tag.
    * Explain the `Dockerfile.deps` purpose (likely installing MATLAB runtime dependencies).
  * **Build Runtime Image:**
    * Similarly, describe the conditional build and the role of `Dockerfile.runtime`.
  * **Build Inventory Image:**
    * Explain how this step bundles the algorithm, potentially using the previously built runtime images.
    * Highlight the tagging strategy: the new semantic version and the 'latest' tag.
  * **Push Inventory Image:** Describe the process of publishing the built and tagged images to GHCR.

# 4. Deployment

* **Strategy:** Explain how the built Docker images are deployed. Do you utilize a separate workflow? Are they deployed manually, or do you use Kubernetes or another orchestration tool?

# 5. Testing (Optional)

* **Unit Tests:** If you have MATLAB unit tests, describe how they are integrated into the pipeline (e.g., in the build stage) and the triggers for test execution.
* **Integration Tests:** If applicable, outline how broader system-level integration tests are incorporated, ensuring the deployed MATLAB algorithm works within the larger application.

# 6. Additional Considerations

* **Security:** Address security measures for GitHub Actions secrets and the GHCR access token.
* **Error Handling:** Outline any error reporting or notification mechanisms integrated into the pipeline.
* **Future Improvements:** Potential areas for pipeline optimization (e.g., caching for Docker builds, parallelizing tests, additional automation steps).
