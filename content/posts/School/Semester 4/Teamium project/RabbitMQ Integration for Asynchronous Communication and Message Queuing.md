# RabbitMQ Integration for Asynchronous Communication and Message Queuing

# 1. Summary

This document outlines the potential benefits and implementation considerations of integrating RabbitMQ, a robust and scalable message broker, into the MATLAB Production Server API wrapper project. RabbitMQ would serve as a message queue to facilitate asynchronous communication between the API wrapper and the MATLAB server, enhancing system performance, reliability, and scalability.

# 2. Introduction

## 2.1 Background

In the current system architecture, the C# API wrapper communicates directly with the MATLAB server to submit calculations and retrieve results. While this approach works well for moderate workloads, it can become a bottleneck as the number of requests increases.

Introducing a message queue like RabbitMQ can address this limitation by decoupling the API wrapper and the MATLAB server. The API wrapper would send messages (representing calculation requests) to the queue, and the MATLAB server would consume messages from the queue, process them, and send results back to the API wrapper (potentially through another queue).

## 2.2 Objectives

* Implement asynchronous communication between the API wrapper and MATLAB server using RabbitMQ.
* Improve system scalability and responsiveness under high load.
* Enhance fault tolerance by buffering messages in the queue in case the MATLAB server is temporarily unavailable.
* Provide a foundation for future expansion of the system with additional message-based communication patterns.

## 3.2 Technologies

* **RabbitMQ:** Open-source message broker.
* **AMQP 0-9-1:** Messaging protocol used by RabbitMQ.
* **C#:** Programming language used for the API wrapper's interaction with RabbitMQ.
* **RabbitMQ .NET Client Library:** Library for connecting to and interacting with RabbitMQ from .NET applications.
* **Docker:** Containerization platform for deploying RabbitMQ.

## 3.3 Configuration

### 3.3.1 Deployment and Orchestration

RabbitMQ is deployed as a container within the same Docker Compose environment as the other components of your system. The `docker-compose.yml` file handles the orchestration, ensuring that RabbitMQ starts up alongside the MATLAB server, API wrapper, database, and MinIO.

The relevant section in `docker-compose.yml` for RabbitMQ is:

````yaml
rabbitmq:
image: rabbitmq:3.13-management
hostname: rabbitmq
ports:
    - "5672:5672"  # AMQP protocol port
    - "15672:15672" # Management UI port
environment:
    - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=$RABBITMQ_USER
    - RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=$RABBITMQ_PASS
networks:
    - matlab-network
````

### 3.3.2 Environment Variables (`.env`)

The `.env` file stores sensitive configuration details, including the RabbitMQ credentials:

* `RABBITMQ_USER`: Specifies the username for accessing the RabbitMQ server (default user is set to `teamium`).
* `RABBITMQ_PASS`: Sets the password for the RabbitMQ user (default password is set to `teamium666`).

### 3.3.3 Key Configuration Details

* **Image:** The `rabbitmq:3.13-management` image is used, which includes the RabbitMQ server and a management plugin for easy monitoring and administration.
* **Hostname:** The hostname is set to `rabbitmq`, making it easier to reference within the Docker network.
* **Ports:**
  * 5672: The standard AMQP port for client connections.
  * 15672: The port for accessing the RabbitMQ management interface.
* **Environment Variables:** The `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` and `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS` variables are used to set the default credentials for the RabbitMQ server.
* **Networking:** The `matlab-network` bridge network allows the RabbitMQ container to communicate with other containers in the environment.

### 3.3.4 Management Interface

The RabbitMQ management interface, accessible at `http://localhost:15672`, provides a web-based UI for:

* Monitoring queues, exchanges, and connections.
* Managing users and permissions.
* Viewing message rates and other statistics.

### 3.3.5 Security Considerations

* **Credentials:** The RabbitMQ credentials (`RABBITMQ_USER` and `RABBITMQ_PASS`) should be kept confidential, as they grant administrative access to the message broker.
* **Network Security:** Consider restricting access to the RabbitMQ management interface and AMQP port to trusted networks or IP addresses.
* **TLS:** Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between the API wrapper, MATLAB server, and RabbitMQ.

# 4. Results & Insights

While the RabbitMQ integration is not yet implemented, the planned design and anticipated outcomes highlight its potential benefits for the MATLAB Production Server API wrapper project:

## 4.1 Key Design Decisions:

1. **Asynchronous Communication:** The decision to use RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging between the API wrapper and MATLAB server is a key architectural choice. This approach promotes loose coupling, scalability, and resilience in the system.

1. **Message Queues:** The use of dedicated queues for calculation requests (`calculation_requests`) and results (`calculation_results`) ensures organized message flow and enables efficient processing of tasks.

1. **Docker Integration:** Deploying RabbitMQ within the existing Docker Compose environment simplifies setup and management, maintaining consistency with the project's containerized infrastructure.

## 4.2 Anticipated Outcomes:

1. **Potential for Enhanced Scalability (with Kubernetes):** While RabbitMQ itself can handle high message throughput, scaling the MATLAB server horizontally within a single Docker container is limited. However, the integration of RabbitMQ lays the groundwork for future scalability when deployed to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes. Kubernetes can easily manage multiple instances of the MATLAB server, allowing RabbitMQ to distribute workloads across them and truly achieve horizontal scalability.

1. **Improved Responsiveness:** By decoupling the API wrapper and MATLAB server, the system can handle requests more efficiently, leading to faster response times for clients.

1. **Fault Tolerance:** The message queue acts as a buffer, ensuring that requests are not lost even if the MATLAB server experiences temporary downtime or high load.

1. **Future Flexibility:** The RabbitMQ integration lays the groundwork for future enhancements, such as implementing priority queues, routing messages based on specific criteria, or integrating with other systems using RabbitMQ's extensive plugin ecosystem.

## 4.3 Potential Challenges:

1. **Message Ordering:** While RabbitMQ guarantees message delivery, the order of message processing might not always be strictly sequential. If message order is critical for your application, additional mechanisms (e.g., sequencing numbers) might be needed.

1. **Error Handling:** Robust error handling strategies must be implemented to address scenarios like message delivery failures, connection issues, or exceptions during message processing.

1. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Regular monitoring of RabbitMQ's performance and health is essential to ensure optimal system operation.

Overall, the planned RabbitMQ integration promises to significantly enhance the MATLAB Production Server API wrapper project's scalability, reliability, and responsiveness. By embracing asynchronous messaging, the system will be better equipped to handle growing workloads and evolving requirements.
